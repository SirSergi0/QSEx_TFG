This repository serves as the primary archive for all data, documentation, and procedural details related to the final project of the Bachelor’s degree in Physics undertaken by Sergio Castañeiras Morales. It is structured to systematically retain and organize all relevant research materials, experimental results, analytical methods, and interpretative insights integral to the project. By consolidating these resources, this repository aims to ensure both the integrity and accessibility of the project’s entire lifecycle, supporting further review, replication, and validation of findings as necessary
